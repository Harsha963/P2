== Project Workflow Design



== Abstract
In this document, we present to you some of the ideas we discussed to improve rural India, along with the requirements and specifications of each product. Some ideas we thought would be helpful are solar energy-supported water filtration systems, solar cookers, wind energy harvesting devices, and rechargeable batteries. We chose these ideas considering the requirements of people, the feasibility of these products, and the feasibility of using green energy to support these devices. The final demonstrable product we decided on is a solar energy-supported water filtration system. This is because the availability of clean drinking water is a significant problem in India. Not all villages can afford water treatment plants, mainly due to the cost of maintaining them. So we decided to reduce the cost by using solar energy. It is a one-time investment, and maintaining it is pretty simple.  Solar energy is also much cleaner than your usual conventional alternatives.  The document also explores the design and the working principle of this product.
== Background
 
== Introduction

DoXFroY means *Do* anything(*X*) **Fro**m anywhere(*Y*). With the advent
of technologies, communication, transportation, and innovation have become
easier with time. People living in metropolitan areas are able to access
the necessary commodities and are benefitting from it, but in stark
contrast is the picture in rural areas where in some places electricity
and internet technologies are yet to reach. Even in metropolitan areas,
it is not that the living conditions of people are good at all places.
People have to toil hard to maintain their living standards in those
costly cities. There is a dire need for systemic level changes and
technological innovations which will make it easier for people to do
their work and avail the necessary services from anywhere. This solution
should also be devised keeping in mind its sustainability. The following
project is a step further in that direction. We are trying to find
possible interventions and changes which would drive the future in the
direction of making DoXFroY culture ubiquitous and sustainable.

== Requirements

To make the culture of the future DoXFroY, we think the following are
the systemic changes and technological interventions which are needed:

=== Rechargeable battery

Electricity in rural areas of India is not present for 24x7 and the problem of power cut hinders technological adoption by the people living in those areas. People also have difficulties while working at night and have to rely on kerosene lamps and wicks for lighting their houses at night. Can we make a light bulb that is able to store energy when there is electricity and thus light up when it is dark during a power cut? The rechargeable bulb can be designed to charge from solar energy also.

==== Cost Requirements
It should be affordable to the people of low-income groups and also to the people who are below the poverty line.

==== Structural Requirements
It should be lightweight and easy to carry.

==== Efficiency Requirements
The battery should be able to light up the bulb for sufficient time to satisfy the need of people.

=== Network of Health Centers
The hospitals are concentrated in towns and it is not possible for people to approach them and they have to sometimes wait for getting necessary health services. In DoXFroY society, people should be able to avail health-related assistance and even emergency services from remote places without much delay. To make this idea a reality, a network of healthcare experts, nurses, doctors, and volunteers needs to be there spread throughout the geography of India which is a distributed network. There would be an app through which people in need of assistance would ask for help and the doctor in the vicinity of the person would get the signal and respond to it. If she comes to conclude that she needs certain blood units, medicines, vials of ointments, etc., she can contact it a nearby storehouse that will dispatch the necessary items with the help of drones to the destination upon receiving a request signal.

=== Project "Paramarth"
People need help sometimes with their work or with their chores. Old people face difficulty in getting some of their work done and might need care as they might be helpless at times with nobody to care for around them. Some people might be seeking some friend to whom they can talk and share some moments so that they do not feel lonely. If we can create a network where people can raise a help request and the potential helpers living in the vicinity might receive it and respond to it then the community would be a much better place to live in. We can give tokens to people who are helping others and one might have to expend some of them to get help. We can also provide extra tokens to old age people or to helpless people.

=== Embedding QR code with important information
A lot of times a particular chapter of a book needs to be updated and the publishers or governments have to retract all the books back and make available new books after the necessary correction. This leads this process to be practically impossible due to the complexity of the logistics involved. We can stick books with stickers containing QR codes that will contain the updated information which was meant to be transmitted. This will make the process of updating the book easier and make information updates seamless across the country.

A lot of ideas were discussed to improve rural India and many products along with their requirements and specifications were also discussed. Some of the ideas that we discussed that would be helpful for people along with why we did not consider them are:

1. 
For Rechargeable batteries - Rural areas present many environmental challenges such as extreme temperatures, humidity, and dust, which can impact the performance of the battery. We found it difficult to solve these challenges while discussing the specifications of the battery. It was also important to design a battery that is easy to use and maintain. We had to consider the usability of the battery and ensure that it is user-friendly for rural people. They can pose safety risks if not used and designed correctly. 

2.
For the Network of health centres and Development of human resources(Under Systemic level changes) - As these industries are heavily regulated, we had to consider how to navigate the regulations and policies related to establishing and maintaining them in rural areas. They often have a shortage of professionals, which makes it challenging to staff and maintain these industries. We had to consider how to attract and retain professionals in rural areas. Rural communities also may have unique cultural beliefs and practices that must be taken into account when developing these industries.
For Project Paramarth and Grievance redressal system and crowdsourcing information from people - There was a lot depending on the willingness of volunteers to participate and help others. We had difficulty in finding and retaining volunteers in rural areas as there were limited incentives or rewards for their participation. Also, providing care for elderly or helpless individuals poses safety risks for both the volunteers and the individuals receiving care so we had to consider the safety concerns involved. Developing a sustainable project that can continue to provide help and support to the community over time requires careful planning and management. We found it difficult to ensure the long-term viability and impact of the projects.

3.
For Embedding QR codes with important information - Rural areas have diverse languages and dialects spoken by the community members. We had to consider how to communicate the information effectively in a way that is understood by everyone in the community. QR codes also require maintenance and regular updating to ensure that the information is accurate and up-to-date which is difficult to ensure due to illiteracy and communication gap. Implementing new technology and systems faces resistance from community members who are used to traditional ways of accessing information which was a major point of concern. 

4.
For Biogas plants, Wind energy harvesting devices, and Solar cookers - Rural areas often lack the necessary infrastructure, such as electricity and water supply, to support the development of the above-mentioned devices. This created challenges in designing and implementing them. It was also challenging to ensure that they maintain these devices and ensure their proper functioning. 
Pedal Power Generator -  Rural areas have limited access to skilled labour, which makes it difficult to build and maintain the generator. We have to provide training to local community members or collaborate with local organisations to access the necessary skills and knowledge. In order to provide benefits to the community over time, requires careful planning and management which we found difficult to ensure.
Finally, we decided to go with a solar energy water filtration system because the availability of clean drinking water is a significant problem in rural areas and water is essential for life.

== Design

=== Components

=== Working Principle
The process of movement of solvent (water, in this case),  through a semipermeable membrane from the solution (unpurified water) to the pure solvent by applying excess pressure on the solution side, to overcome osmotic pressure is called Reverse Osmosis (RO). In the normal osmosis process, which is driven by chemical potential differences of the solvent, a thermodynamic parameter, the water moves from low solute concentration to high solute concentration. In the RO process, the movement is in the opposite direction. In RO desalination almost all (around 95 to 99%) dissolved salts are filtered into the rejected stream, and solar-powered RO desalination can reduce or interrupt the dependency on conventional energy fossil fuels, reduces additional costs and results in environmental safety with sustainability and a disease-free community. A solar PV module (a series connected sufficient number of solar cells to provide required standard output voltage and power) can be used to act as a power supply for operating functions for desalination, such as a booster pump to pressurise the water flow into RO desalination elements through a rack of vessels containing semi-permeable membranes.

=== Evaluation criteria of the project

=== Scope of the project
These are the techniques that can be added to the project:

UV filtration: UV filtration can be added to the project to further purify the water. UV filtration uses ultraviolet light to kill bacteria and viruses, making it an effective method for water treatment.The effectiveness of UV filtration depends on several factors, including the intensity of the UV light, the exposure time of the water to the UV light, and the water quality. The water must be pre-treated to remove any particles or debris that could block the UV light from reaching the microorganisms in the water.

Pre filtration: pre-filtration techniques such as activated carbon or sediment filters, which can remove impurities like chlorine, sediment, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) before the water enters the reverse osmosis membrane.

Storage tank: incorporating a storage tank with the system can help in providing a continuous supply of purified water even when the sun is not shining.

Mineralization: Reverse osmosis removes minerals from the water, which can lead to taste issues and potential health problems. Mineralization can add back the essential minerals like calcium and magnesium to improve the taste and make the water healthier to drink.

pH adjustment: Reverse osmosis can also cause the water to become slightly acidic. pH adjustment can help bring the water to a more neutral level, making it more pleasant to drink and reducing the risk of corrosion in pipes.

Monitoring and control system: Adding a monitoring and control system to the project can help in ensuring the proper functioning of the system. This can include sensors to measure water quality, pressure, and flow rates, as well as a control panel to adjust system settings and track performance.

Remote monitoring: Remote monitoring can be added to the system to allow for real-time monitoring and control from a remote location. This can be useful in situations where the system is located in a remote or hard-to-reach area.

Energy storage: Incorporating energy storage, such as batteries, can help in providing a continuous supply of purified water even when the solar power is not available. This can be particularly useful in areas with limited sunlight or during cloudy weather.

Mobile unit: Designing the system as a mobile unit can allow it to be easily transported to areas where access to clean water is limited, such as disaster-stricken areas or refugee camps. This can help in providing immediate relief to those in need.

== Product Development

== Challenges
Challenges:
Reverse osmosis water purification with solar electricity can be a practical method for supplying clean drinking water in off-grid remote places. To make this approach possible and effective, though, a number of issues must be resolved. Some of these difficulties include:

1. Energy requirements: Reverse osmosis requires a lot of energy to operate, and solar power may not always be able to supply the system with the energy it needs. The amount of energy needed can change based on the water source's quality, the system's capacity, and the surrounding conditions.

2. Water quality: Although reverse osmosis can effectively remove a variety of pollutants, including germs and viruses, it might not be able to remove all of them. To ensure that the water satisfies the necessary quality standards, pre-treatment of the water may be necessary.

3. Membrane fouling: Reverse osmosis systems might lose efficiency as a result of clogged membranes caused by impurities over time. In places with large concentrations of dissolved solids or organic materials, this may be a particular issue.

4. Maintenance: Reverse osmosis systems fueled by solar must undergo routine maintenance to keep working properly. In remote locations where qualified specialists might not be easily accessible, this can be difficult.

5. Cost: Reverse osmosis systems that run on solar energy can be pricey to construct and operate. Some groups, especially those in developing countries, may find the cost of the system to be prohibitive.

6. Water scarcity: Reverse osmosis systems might not be a good option in places with a limited supply of water because they need a lot of water to run and maintain them.

To ensure that solar-powered reverse osmosis systems are long-lasting and efficient in supplying clean drinking water to underserved populations, these issues must be addressed. This will take a mix of technical know-how, financial commitment, and community involvement.


== Discussion and Future Work

As a team, our work was related to DoXFroY because we followed a problem-solving approach that focused on the needs of specific communities. We sought to understand the challenges and problems faced by these communities and designed solutions that met their unique requirements. This approach enabled us to create impactful and sustainable solutions that were tailored to the needs of the beneficiaries.

To make DoXFroY a reality, several actions can be taken. First, there needs to be a shift in mindset among individuals and organizations, where they prioritize the needs of the end-users or beneficiaries. This can be achieved by promoting empathy, encouraging active listening, and fostering cross-cultural understanding.
Second, there needs to be more collaboration and partnerships between different stakeholders, including governments, non-profits, and the private sector. These partnerships can help leverage resources, expertise, and knowledge to develop more impactful and sustainable solutions.

Third, education and training programs can be developed to promote the DoXFroY approach among individuals and organizations. This can include courses on design thinking, empathy, and human-centered design, among others.
Finally, systemic level changes are needed to create an environment that supports the development and implementation of DoXFroY initiatives. This can include policy changes, funding mechanisms, and regulatory frameworks that prioritize social impact and innovation. By creating an enabling environment, systemic level changes can help to promote and scale the adoption of DoXFroY in different sectors and industries.

In conclusion, making DoXFroY a reality requires a combination of individual, organizational, and systemic level changes. By adopting a DoXFroY approach, we can design and develop innovative solutions that are more effective, impactful, and sustainable, and that meet the unique needs of the communities we are trying to serve.

== Conclusion

Our project aimed to address the problem of clean drinking water scarcity in rural India using a sustainable and affordable solution. We identified the need for a solar energy-supported water filtration system and ideated a prototype to meet the requirements of the communities. However, we also recognized the challenges and limitations of implementing such a solution and identified areas for future work. 

Our project was aligned with the DoXFroY approach, which prioritizes the needs of the end-users and focuses on developing impactful and sustainable solutions. We believe that by adopting this approach, we can design and develop innovative solutions that are more effective, impactful, and sustainable and that meet the unique needs of the communities we are trying to serve. 

In conclusion, our project highlights the importance of community-driven problem-solving and the potential of sustainable solutions to address critical social and environmental issues. We hope that our work can inspire others to adopt a similar approach and contribute to creating a more equitable and sustainable world.
